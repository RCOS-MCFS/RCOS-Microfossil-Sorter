Program Purpose: Sort microfossils from gravel using color values, using a trained Sklearn_SVM machine learning package in python, and outline the fossils with a contour. 

Technologies: Sklearn_SVM, tested on Windows 10, PyCharm 2018.2.3, Python 3.6

Before the program is ran, the user must install the following packages.

Packages needed:


numpy,
opencv-python, 
pip, 
progressbar2, 
python-utils, 
scipy,
*scikit-learn, 
setuptools,
six

*Scipy must be installed first for scikit-learned to be installed 
**It is highly recommended that an Python IDE is used because they have few problems with installing differnet packages.

live_demo:
runs the sorter program by initialing the camera uses trained machine learning package to sort samples. There are 2 options to run this program, one 
with the capability of training while running, and using strictly a pre trained machine learning approach.

To run on terminal:
\live_demo.py [machine learning approach] [camera_number] [bones photos folder path] [path to gravel photos]

\live_demo.py  [machine learning approach] [camera_number] [weight file]
*note: weight file for pre trained machine learning

*note: camera number default is commonly 0 and all directory path in the parameters need to be absolute.

example: C:\Users\name\folder\path\image_folder\image


To run in PyCharm IDE:
After cloning the Microfossil sorter, and opening directory in PyCharm,
go to live_demo program configurations with the parameters.


Once running the program should open a window, with a live video of the objects in front of the selected camera.
Above there will be slider that allow the user to change the lower and upper limits, erosion level, and kernel size.

lower and upper limits: Changes the pixel shading levels. If you increase the lower and Upper bounds the live images'
color can be darken.

erosion level: Changes the pixel size of all images in the live feed congurently.Lowering the level allows more pixel detail.

kernel size: Increase the pixel size of the live image.Lowering the size allows more pixel detail.

When the machine learning detects a bone, the object will be outlined in a green contour along with a label saying bone.
Else when it dectects a rock, it will be labeled as rock and be contoured by blue.
